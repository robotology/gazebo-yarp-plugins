The format of this document is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.7.0] - 2023-06-05

### Changed

- The `gazebo_imu` plugin used to output orientation measurements as if the sensor was zero-aligned with the world frame, regardless of the initial orientation of the part the sensor is attached to. To match most real-world IMUs, the default behavior was changed to allow measuring orientation with regard to the world frame at all times. The old behavior can be restored by setting the `useInitialSensorOrientationAsReference` config option (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/639).
- The `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` plugin is compiled using C++ 20 compiler features (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/650).
- The `BaseCouplingHandler::decoupleVelRef()` methods within `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` provides an input argument containing the full joints position feedback, to be used to implement velocity decoupling laws that depend on the joints position.

### Fixed

- Fix wrong install include for gazebo_yarp_lib_common library (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/644).
- Fix wrong implementation of coupling handlers of ergoCub MK5 hands within the `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` plugin (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/650).

## [4.6.0] - 2023-01-13

### Added

- In `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` add the `icub_hand_mk5` coupling that models the iCub mk5 hand, that is used also in ergoCub 1 robot (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/641).

## [4.5.2] - 2022-11-17

### Fixed
- Fix compatibility with YARP 3.8 (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/640).

## [4.5.1] - 2022-08-31

### Fixed
- Fix behaviour of MultipleAnalogSensor `get**Name` methods in nested models (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/633).

## [4.5.0] - 2022-08-23

### Added
- The `gazebo_yarp_forcetorque` plugin now exposes also the `yarp::dev::ISixAxisForceTorqueSensors` interface, so it can be used with ` multipleanalogsensorsserver`, `multipleanalogsensorsremapper` and `multipleanalogsensorsclient` devices (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/issues/384, https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/628).

### Fixed
- Fix YARP 3.8 compatibility (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/627).

## [4.4.0] - 2022-05-31

### Fixed
- Removed implicit conversions from the depth data quantization in `GazeboYarpDepthCameraDriver::getDepthImage` which in at least one occasion caused an unexpected crash of the `rgbdSensor_nws_yarp`. Also, the calculation of the scalar coefficient (involving `math::pow`), used to cut the decimal figures from the depth data, has been moved outside the for loop that cycles through the whole image (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/623).
- In `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` update the parameters in `icub_left_hand_mk4` regarding pinkie and thumb which are used to generate the look-up table to approximate the coupling laws. (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/624)

## [4.3.0] - 2022-04-04

### Added
- In `gazebo_yarp_camera` parse the `yarpDeviceName` option to enable its use with `gazebo_yarp_robotinterface` (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/614).
- In `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` add the `icub_left_hand_mk4` coupling that models the iCub mk4 left hand (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/620).

### Changed
- Migrate the example models under the tutorial directory to avoid the use of implicit network wrapper servers, and use the `gazebo_yarp_robotinterface` plugin to spawn their network wrapper servers (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/615 and https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/616).

### Fixed
- It is now possible to remove and add again to the simulation models that use `gazebo_yarp_robotinterface` without any crash (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/618, https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/619).
- Fixed value returned by getDeviceStatus method in `gazebo_yarp_laser` plugin (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/617).

## [4.2.0] - 2022-02-28

### Added
- Added `disableImplicitNetworkWrapper` option to `gazebo_yarp_forcetorque`, `gazebo_yarp_depthcamera`, `gazebo_yarp_lasersensor`, `gazebo_yarp_imu` and `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` plugins. If present, this option
disable any network wrapper server that the plugin created, by just creating the device itself. This option is meant to be used in conjuction with the `gazebo_yarp_robotinterface` plugin, that can be used to launch and attach any networ wrapper server. This option is equivalent to the behavior that can be obtained by setting the CMake option `GAZEBO_YARP_PLUGINS_DISABLE_IMPLICIT_NETWORK_WRAPPERS` to `OFF` (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/586).
- The possibility to limit the decimal places of the pixels values has been added to the `gazebo_yarp_depthcamera` plugin, via the `QUANT_PARAM::depth_quant` parameter. The data modification is performed in the `GazeboYarpDepthCameraDriver::getDepthImage` function (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/608).


### Fixed
- Removed `getLastInputStamp` method from `LaserSensorDriver` class in `gazebo_yarp_lasersensor`. Furthermore, fix bug in `gazebo_yarp_lasersensor`, by adding the update to the variable `m_timestamp` inherited from `yarp::dev::Lidar2DDeviceBase` (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/604).
- Fix use of yarpConfigurationString parameter in `gazebo_yarp_worldinterface` plugin (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/609).

## [4.1.2] - 2022-01-19

### Fixed
- Fix compilation against YARP 3.7 (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/607, https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/issues/608).

## [4.1.1] - 2022-01-13

### Fixed
- Fix compilation against Gazebo 11.10.0 (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/605, https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/issues/606).

## [4.1.0] - 2021-12-23

### Changed
- The `gazebo_yarp_forcetorque` plugin now handle the `yarpDeviceName` parameter (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/584).
- The `gazebo_yarp_forcetorque` plugin can be now opened without implicit wrapper, by using the `GAZEBO_YARP_PLUGINS_DISABLE_IMPLICIT_NETWORK_WRAPPERS` CMake option (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/584).
- The `gazebo_imu` plugin now handle the `yarpDeviceName` parameter (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/583).
- The `gazebo_imu` plugin can be now opened without implicit wrapper, by using the `GAZEBO_YARP_PLUGINS_DISABLE_IMPLICIT_NETWORK_WRAPPERS` CMake option (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/583).

### Fixed
- Fixed compilation with YARP 3.6 (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/599).

## [4.0.0] - 2021-09-03

### Added
- The multicamera plugin now implements the `yarp::dev::IRgbVisualParams` interface (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/558).
- The controlboard and multicamera plugins now handle the `yarpDeviceName` parameter (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/559).

### Changed
- `gazebo_yarp_multicamera`, `gazebo_yarp_lasersensor`, `gazebo_yarp_doublelaser`, `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` and `gazebo_yarp_depthCamera` plugins now log messages using the ["Log Components" YARP logging feature](http://www.yarp.it/git-master/yarp_logging.html).
- A cmake option (`GAZEBO_YARP_PLUGINS_DISABLE_IMPLICIT_NETWORK_WRAPPERS`) has been added, if this option is enabled then implicit wrappers present in`gazebo_yarp_multicamera`, `gazebo_yarp_lasersensor`, `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` and `gazebo_yarp_depthCamera` are removed, the new way to have them is to attach the new nws to gazebo devices via yarprobotinterface.
- `gazebo-yarp-plugins` now requires YARP 3.5 (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/562).
- In the `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` plugin configuration, if the `[VELOCITY_CONTROL]` group is present the `velocityControlImplementationType` parameter is now compulsory, and model loading will fail if it is not set.

### Fixed
- Fixed the getRgbIntrinsicParam method in the depthCamera plugin when the distortion is not set (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/558).
- The property returned by `getRgbIntrinsicParam()`, now contains `rectificationMatrix` instead of `rectificationMatrix` (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/558, see also https://github.com/robotology/yarp/pull/2593).

### Removed
- The `gazebo_yarp_jointsensors` and the `gazebo_yarp_doublelaser` have been removed (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/574).
- The support for Gazebo 9 and 10 has been removed. `gazebo-yarp-plugins` now requires Gazebo 11 (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/575).


## [3.6.2] - 2021-08-27

## Deprecated
- The `gazebo_yarp_jointsensors` and the `gazebo_yarp_doublelaser` have been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of `gazebo-yarp-plugins`.

## [3.6.1] - 2021-05-19

### Fixed
- Fixed use of libYARP_robotinterface with YARP devices spawned by sensor plugins (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/544).
- Fixed compilation against YARP 3.5 by removing spurious print in WorldInterface plugin (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/548).

## [3.6.0] - 2021-02-24

### Added
- Add `refSpeed` and `refAcceleration` options to the `TRAJECTORY_GENERATION` group of the `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` plugin
  configuration. They are expected to hold exactly n_joints values (an error is reported otherwise) describing reference speeds
  and accelerations, respectively, for use by the selected trajectory generator (if necessary).
- Add `trapezoidal_speed` as a new supported value for option `trajectory_type` of the `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` plugin
  configuration. This generator enables the trajectory to follow a trapezoidal speed profile in position control mode, limited
  by provided reference speed (saturation) and acceleration (both ramps) values. If already executing a trajectory in this manner,
  newly generated trajectories take into account previous joint velocities and update the motion accordingly.
- Add `gazebo_yarp_robotinterface` plugin, the documentation for it can be found at [plugins/robotinterface/README.md](plugins/robotinterface/README.md) (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/532).
- The `gazebo_yarp_depthcamera` and `gazebo_yarp_doublesensor` now accept a `yarpDeviceName` parameter (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/532).

### Changed
- The `deviceId` parameter of the `gazebo_yarp_lasersensor` is now named `yarpDeviceName` )https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/532).

### Fixed
- Fix the support for running Gazebo itself with the `gazebo_yarp_clock` with YARP_CLOCK set, without Gazebo freezing at startup.
  In particular, setting YARP_CLOCK is suggested to ensure that all the threads of YARP Network Wrapper Servers are executed with
  the frequency correctly synchronized with the Gazebo simulation (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/537).

## [3.5.1] - 2020-10-05

### Added
- Add `velocityControlImplementationType` option to the `VELOCITY_CONTROL` group of the `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` plugin
  configuration. This option permits to switch between `direct_velocity_pid`, that is using a velocity PID for the Velocity Control Mode
  (what has been implemented until now) and `integrator_and_position_pid` that uses an integrator that integrates the velocity reference and then uses the position low level PID, similarly to what is implement on real YARP-powered robot such as iCub or R1.
  The setting is now optional and if not present will default to `direct_velocity_pid`, but it will be compulsory in
  gazebo-yarp-plugins 4.x (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/514).

### Fixed
- Fixed use of the `VOCAB_CM_MIXED` control mode when the physics timestep is different from 1 millisecond (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/514).
- Fixed missing initialization of a pointer in `gazebo_yarp_controlboard` . In some cases this was causing crashes when a model that contained a `gazebo_yarp_controlboard`
  plugin was removed from the simulation (https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins/pull/514).

## [3.5.0] - 2020-08-26

### Added
